Defend-The-Herd
===============

Defend the herd is a 2d IOS game made with unity during a hackathon in the summer of 2014. The purpose of this game is simple, defend your herd of goats from the hungry wolves. simply tap on the wolves, and your farmer will run towards them and attack them. Keep the wolves away from the goats, or the goats will die, and you will lose. Upgrade your farmers weapon for cool aesthetics as well as increased damage, and upgrade your fence to keep the wolves away longer.
